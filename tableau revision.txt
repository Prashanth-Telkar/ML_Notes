TABLEAU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHaOIvR00So&t=1490s
- Tableau is a software company which produces interactive data visualization product focused on BI(business intelegence).
- Visualization: it allows us visual acess to huge amount of data in easily digestible visuals. 
- Tableau is very flexible since it has optimal number of data connectors for databases. For exmple we can connect to excel, text, json files, microsoft excel, oracle servers, sql servers.
- Data connections- 1.Live connections 2.Inmemory connections.
- Tableau Datatypes: 	1. Text(string) values- Welcome to tableau.
			2. Date values- October 18, 2021
			3. Date and time values- October 18, 2021 18:43:00 PM
			4. Numerical values- decimal number(5.0000) , whole number(5)
			5. Boolean values- True/False
			6. Geographical values- India, New York	
- Tableau auto detects all the DataType. (We dont need to specify)(we can also explicitly define if we want to).
- Dimensions consists of text, geographic, date and number(Row id-since it is independent variable) data types.
- A Dimention is a field that is independent variable. The dimention is usually text.
- Measures consists of Numeric data types.
- A Measures is a field that is dependent variable and its value is a function of one or more Dimentions. A Measure is usually a nuumber.
- Once we connect to a data source in Tableau the columns get divided into dimensions and measures. 
- A Dimension is a field that is independent variables.
- A Measure is a field that is dependent variable and its value is a fuction of one or more dimesions.
- Show me in the Tableau shows all the possible visualisations available for our data sources.
- The visualisations that are highlighted are the once that are currently available for the current selection of dimensions and measures. (Remaning are not compateble for the current 
  selection).
- Types of graphs- 	Bar graph(horizontal, vertical bar graphs)- Used when dimention is Discontinuous.
			Line graph- Continuous dimention.
			Dual Axis graph-to represent two measures together.
			Geographical grah-to plot measures on geographical maps.
			Area graph with Dual Axis-to measure two different quantities across geographical locations.
			Heat Map(Popular graph)-to visualise variations across categories using colour intensities.
			Tree Map-to represent quantity and density in nested rectangles.
- Column entries goes to X-axis, Row entries goes to Y-axis.
- Functions in Tableau:
- Join and Union functions are used to perform operations to combine data. Join - Combine Column(inner join and outer join like SQL), 
									   Union - Combine Rows(Here the constraint is tat the attributes/columns should be the same)
- Sort: Sort function can be used to sort categories and sub-categories based on their measure.
- Set: Set is a type of filter where we can set a condition for displaying values, eg Discount>10%
- Forcasting: Forcasting is used to predict the future trends based on the current values of graph.
- Heighlighting: It is used to heighlight specific sub categories among all others. (among mutiples lines in a single graph one line is heilighted)
- Device Designer: It is used to make best visualization for specific device. (Like it will change the visualization when using in tablet to fit it all necessary commands)

- Steps in visual analysis: Acquire | Filter | Enhance(plot visualization) | Tune(tune the visualization to enhance the visualization power) | Deliver
- Desiding which graph to be used is also one of the factor to bring accurate insights from the data.
- Tableau Family: Tableau Desktop --Tableau Reader(This is free and just a reader. here we cannot edit the visualization. we can only apply filters)
				  --Tableau Public (We can create visuals and also publish it)
				  --Tableau Server (for corporates)
 				  --Tableau Online
- Pros of Tableau: Easy to use (interactive and easy)
		   Direct connect and go (it can connect to any data source. integrate multiple sources. also it can connect live)
		   Perfect Mashups
		   Best Practices in box (it has everthing required for make our visualization perfect)
- Joins: Left Join | Right Join | Inner Join | Full Outer Join  
- Left Join: evething from left table and only enteries of right table overlapping with left table will be included
- Right Join: evething from Right table and only enteries of left table overlapping with Right table will be included
- Inner Join: inclues only enteries which are comman in both tables
- Full Outer Join: Includes everything
- If there is no density parameter then we cannot use heatmap.
- Filters: SQL costum filters, Context filters, traditional filters. (All these will help in enahancing the visualisation).
- Hierarchy: it provides a way to start with a high level overview of your data and then drill down to lower levels of details on demand.  
- Groups will also helps in organise and manage your fileds.
- Sets : Sets are nothing but group of dimentions.
- Sets are costume fields that define a subset of data based on some conditions.
- Set can be based on computed condition.
- for example, a set may contain costumers with sales over a certain threshold.
- sets update as your data changes.
- set can be based on specific data point in your view.
